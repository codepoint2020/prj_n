*****Do i need a separate column for address_identifier, and that identifier will also be in the address table, maybe for entering the address
users can just choose drop down button if each address line is already available in the database if not have them manually type, this also means
that i need to create a code to enable the system to identify if what they are typing is in the database.


if is_disabled prevent the user to login and display the account status to the administrator

4-24-23 - Since some files such as videos and images are heavy they were added to .gitignore, modify the system
in order to display an alternate image, if working on a different device that don't have those files.

*prevent uploads for .exe, .cmd etc., implement whitelist
